#### CS184.1x Foundations of Computer Graphics - Berkeley

Basic OpenGL & GLSL, a ray tracer for the final assignment. This course doesn't teach you how to build computer games, but it does show you some fundamentals of graphics.

#### Ec1011x Principles of Economics with Calculus - Caltech

Started on 2014.1.6, 12 weeks

An intro course on economics, with plenty of math. The contents are the same as the on-campus Ec1011 course at Caltech.

#### CS143 Compilers - Stanford

2014.3.17 - 2014.6.2, 11 weeks

Build a compiler for COOL - Classroom Object-Oriented Language (with C++ or Java, your choice) throughout the course. A fascinating course indeed, but be prepared for the heavy load, because the programming assignments are **very** challenging. This course is pretty much the same as the on-campus CS143 course at Stanford.

#### CSE341 Programming Languages - University of Washington

2014.10.2 - 2014.12.1, 10 weeks

Different programming paradigms - especially functional programming, SML, Racket, Ruby used. A very well-designed course, and it has the same contents of the real CSE341 on campus. After taking it, you will come to understand a lot of terms which seems mysterious to you now (functional? closures? ...), and you will be a better programmer for sure.

#### Machine Learning - Stanford

2014.9.22 - 2014.12.15, 10 weeks

Usual machine learning methods in practice, with well-designed programming assignments to help you get the feelings. It is much **easier** than the real CS229 Machine Learning course at Stanford.
