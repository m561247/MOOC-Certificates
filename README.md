## My MOOC Certificates

#### Probability - National Taiwan University

2013.8.31 - 2013.11.9, 10 weeks

A good introduction to probability, basic concepts and theories, common distributions covered.

#### CS184.1x Foundations of Computer Graphics - Berkeley

Started on 2014.10.6, 6 weeks

Basic OpenGL & GLSL, a ray tracer for the final assignment. This course doesn't teach you how to build computer games, but it does show you some fundamentals of graphics.

#### Ec1011x Principles of Economics with Calculus - Caltech

Started on 2014.1.6, 12 weeks

An intro course on economics, with plenty of math. The contents are the same as the on-campus Ec1011 course at Caltech.

#### CS143 Compilers - Stanford

2014.3.17 - 2014.6.2, 11 weeks

Build a compiler for COOL - Classroom Object-Oriented Language (with C++ or Java, your choice) throughout the course. A fascinating course indeed, but be prepared for the heavy load, because the programming assignments are **very** challenging. This course is pretty much the same as the on-campus CS143 course at Stanford.

#### CSE341 Programming Languages - University of Washington

2014.10.2 - 2014.12.1, 10 weeks

Different programming paradigms - especially functional programming, SML, Racket, Ruby used. A very well-designed course, and it has the same contents of the real CSE341 on campus. After taking it, you will come to understand a lot of terms which seems mysterious to you now (functional? closures? ...), and you will be a better programmer for sure.

#### Machine Learning - Stanford

2014.9.22 - 2014.12.15, 10 weeks

Usual machine learning methods in practice, with well-designed programming assignments to help you get the feelings. It is much **easier** than the real CS229 Machine Learning course at Stanford.

#### Machine Learning Techniques - National Taiwan University

2014.12.23 - 2015.2.24, 8 weeks

A much deeper machine learning course, which covers a number of classical machine learning models: SVM (with and without kernels, hard and soft margins), decision tree (random forests), adaboost, neural networks. This course has **much more math** than Andrew Ng's (some say that Andrew's course isn't even enough as a prerequisite...). It also requires you to code up some of the important algorithms by yourself so that you get some handful practice. This course has the same content as the second half of the ML course on campus at NTU. The first half is offered as another course in Coursera - 'Machine Learning Foundations'.
